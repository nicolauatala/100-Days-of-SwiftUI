# My [**100 Days of SwiftUI challenge**](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)

### Rules
If you want to make a success of this course, there are only two rules:
1.  Every day you spend one hour reading or watching SwiftUI tutorials, or writing SwiftUI code.
2.  Every day you post about your progress to the social media site of your choosing. Tell people!
